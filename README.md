A memory network similar to the one described in:

`End-To-End Memory Networks, by S. Sukhbaatar, J. Weston, and R. Fergus, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2015`

`Deep Learning with Keras by Sujit Pal; Antonio Gulli, 2017`

The goal of the model is to answer simple questions about short sentences.

Example:

Story - Sandra travelled to the hallway. 
John went to the garden.
 
Question - Where is sandra ?
